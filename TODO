This is a list of ideas of how to improve piqi-erlang.

Current issues and feature requests: https://github.com/alavrik/piqi-erlang/issues


Improvements
------------

- Automatic schema reload for multi-format serialization. Automatically
  reload/re-init Piqi modules when Erlang _piqi modules get hot-loaded. Without
  automatic handing, the easiest way to do it manually is to run `piqi:stop(),
  piqi:start().` Needless to say, doing this often quickly becomes annoying.


New features
------------

- optionally, copy sub-binaries during deserialization
- optionally, treat Piqi enums as Erlang integers and generate enum constants as
  macros instead of atoms


Optimizations
-------------

- faster piqi_tools.erl pooling especially for short-lived processes such as
  used by Piqi-RPC
- profile and optimize piqirun.erl especially on recent Erlang releases


Packaging
---------

- drop piqi-binary as a dependency and rely having a compatible version of piqi
  in path (after piqi-0.7.0 is release)
- add piqic-erlang --version and --piqi-version options


Miscellaneous
-------------

- add examples/piq-config that uses frameless Piq as input/output; see
  piqi-ocaml/examples/piq-config for details

- more tests
